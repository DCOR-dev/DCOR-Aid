        """MD5-creating progress wrapper of file objects for partial access

        Uploading large files to S3 is normally via a multipart upload.
        This is not the multipart upload known from the `requests`
        package, but an S3-specific multipart upload. The file is split
        into multiple parts and each of the parts is uploaded individually.
        Partial access to a file is what this class facilitates. It also
        comes with the convenience of computing the MD5 sum (via the `md5`
        method) and a `callback` method for tracking the progress of the
        upload in another thread.

        Parameters
        ----------
        file_object: file-like
            object implementing seek and read
        file_size: int
            size of the file in bytes
        part_number: int
            multipart upload part number, indexing starts at 0
        part_size: int
            part size of each multipart upload part, the final
            part may be smaller than this number
        min_read_size: int
            minimum number of bytes to read for every call to the function;
            Note that this is a hack that speeds up the upload with
            Python requests, similar to what is proposed here:
            https://github.com/requests/toolbelt/issues/75
            #issuecomment-237189952
        callback: callable
            method to call for monitoring the progress; this is
            called when `read` is called and calls the method
            with the argument `amount_seen / file_size` (overall
            percentage, not only for the current part).

        Notes
        -----
        Do not use the same `file_object` for parallel uploads.
        The init method calls `file_object.seek` to go to the
        correct place in the file. If you want to do parallel
        uploads, you have to instantiate one file object for
        each `FilePart`.

    The returned ETag is checked against the MD5 sum of the file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path: str or pathlib.Path
        path to the file that is uploaded
    file_size: int
        size of `path`
    presigned_url: str
        presigned URL for the upload

        How many times each request should be retried if failed
    timeout: float
        Timeout for requests
    callback: callable
        method to call for monitoring the progress; This is
        called periodically during the upload with a number
        between 0 (start) and 1 (finished).

    Returns
    -------
    etag: str
        ETag of the uploaded file in object store

    Notes
    -----
    If you are interested in creating the presigned URL for a PUT request,
    take a look at the boto3 documentation here:
    https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/s3/client/put_object.html#put-object
    For an actual implementation in Python (which is used in DCOR), take a
    look at the method `create_presigned_upload_urls` here:
    https://github.com/DCOR-dev/dcor_shared/blob/master/dcor_shared/s3.py
    For a single PUT request, it looks like this::

        psurl = s3_client.generate_presigned_url(
             "put_object",
             Params={'Bucket': bucket_name,
                     'Key': object_name,
                     },
             ExpiresIn=expiration,
             HttpMethod='PUT',
         )
    """ # noqa
    retries = max(1, retries)
    with path.open("rb") as fd:
        monitor = UploadMonitorLink(fd=fd,
                                    file_size=file_size,
                                    monitor_callback=callback)
        etag = requests_put_data_and_get_etag(
